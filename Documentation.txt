Library Management System - Documentation
This document provides a basic overview of the library management system project.

Components:

	main.py: Main script for running the library application.
	library.py: Contains the Library class that manages library data (items, users, checkouts).
	Potentially other files (depending on implementation):
		item.py: Might contain a base Item class or separate classes for different item types (e.g., Book, Movie).
		user.py: Might contain a User class to manage user information.
		storage.py (optional): Might contain functions for saving and loading data from a file (e.g., JSON).
	Data Model:
		Items: Represent library items (likely books in this example). Attributes might include title, author, ISBN, availability status, etc. (potentially defined in item.py).
		Users: Represent library members. Attributes might include user ID, name, etc. (potentially defined in user.py).
		Checkouts: Represent borrowed items. Attributes might include a reference to the borrowed item, reference to the borrowing user, and checkout date.
	Functionalities:
		Adding Items: Allows adding new items (books) to the library collection.
		Updating Items: Allows modifying information of existing items.
		Deleting Items: Allows removing items from the library collection.
		Listing Items: Displays a list of all or filtered items.
		Searching Items: Enables searching for items based on title, author, ISBN, etc.
		Adding Users: Allows registering new users as library members. (Might be omitted)
		Checking Out Items: Allows users to borrow items.
		Checking In Items: Allows users to return borrowed items.
		Saving and Exiting: Saves library data to a file (e.g., JSON) and exits the program.

Running the System:

	Ensure you have Python installed (version 3 recommended).
	Save the provided Python files (e.g., main.py, library.py) in the same directory.
	Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the files.
	Run the program using the command: python main.py


Further Improvements:

	Add error handling for user input and invalid data.
	Implement functionalities for managing user information (update, delete).
	Include date handling for due dates and overdue notices (for checkouts).
	In future, enhance search functionalities with more criteria and filtering options.
